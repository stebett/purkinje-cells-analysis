# Redo
- Can we start from the data we have, or should we redo spike sorting?
- Spline fitting, also doing it for fast vs slow groups trials?
- Everything where we don't have precise data I guess

# Open questions
### Individual units within a microzone encode related but distinct elements of the movements
- Can we test this hypothesis?
- Can we extract other elements of the movements? (e.g. acceleration, direction, movement distance)
- Would it make sense to look for preferred values of those features of a neurons? 
- For example we could plot the firing rate vs speed and distance and look for significant variations (spline for single neuron and pca for multiple neurons?)

### Individual spikes are coordinated between neighbor cells
- That means that those cells produce transient events of inhibition of their postsynaptic targets
	+ Can we show some behavioral effect? (I don't think so actually, but it would be cool to test this hypothesis in some way)
