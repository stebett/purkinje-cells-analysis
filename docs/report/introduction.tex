\section{Introduction}

It is well known that the cerebellum plays an important role in coordination of movements, thanks to its interactions with the motor cortex. Purkinje cells, the only output neurons in the cerebellum, are the subject of this study. 

The problem that cerebellum solves is that control of movement based purely on sensory input is hard to achieve, since the feedback is too slow.

Current theories suggest that an internal inverse model \cite{wolpert1998internal} could manage to achieve coordination. The idea is that the cerebellum, having knowledge of the state of the system, could be able to predict the right motor command so that the next state is the desired one.

This research focuses on the study of dynamics displayed by multi-cell activity. Neural population dynamics during reaching has been already investigated for motor cortex \cite{churchland2012neural}, but there is currently scarce knowledge on cerebellum from this perspective.
Understanding the computations carried out inside the cerebellum would be extremely valuable, especially for robotic motor control \cite{casellato2014adaptive}. The objective of this research is hence to perform an exploratory analysis, trying to expose some important feature of Purkinje cells dynamics.

The work presented here is based on previous unpublished research, where analyses were done in the direction of showing synchronicity at very short time scales between neighbor neurons.
