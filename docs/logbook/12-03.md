# Reproducing smooth spline analysis

# Doing
- [ ] test simulations
- [ ] Start simulations


# Todo
- [ ] Clustering psth around landmark
- [ ] **figure 4**
	- [ ] example spline fits
	- [ ] simulated cells

# Done
- [x] Fix simulations -> understand why single cell uniformdf fails
- [x] 3x2 parameters for simulation: all vs neigh vs dist X multipsth vs lift
- [x] separated "simple" and "complex" analysis
