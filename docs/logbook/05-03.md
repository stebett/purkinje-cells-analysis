# Starting to reproduce spline

I'll rewrite the pipeline to fit smooth splines on data from R to julia.
What is already clear is that the process should be something like this:

1. select pairs of cells
2. select the union of their most active intervals
3. build 2 small dataframes, with binarized spiketrains, binarized isi, time from last spike of the other one, and trial number
4. uniformize them (?)
4. Fit them using gss.compute, that is going to call gssanova with different dependent variables

### What I need to figure out

1. How to uniformize
2. What gssanova wants as input
3. How to produce the data in Julia
4. How to transfer the data to R (Arrow?)
5. Try out some Spline package in Julia (they need to accept more than 1 dep. variable and to return confidence intervals)
6. If it fails, it would be cool to extend them or to reimplement from the math the gss spline model
