# Testing spline pipeline

Transfer dataframe from Julia to R, test results on both 

- Transformed event to only 0s and 1s
- There are *less values at the beginning of the series* in R, maybe he's cutting the first spike away

- reproduced (partially) gss.analysis in Julia, calling gssanova and quickPredict from gss and STAR respectively

- plotting works, *the x values need rescaling*
