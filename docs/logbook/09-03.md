# Testing spline pipeline

### Doing
- [ ] rescale x values on plots -> use inverse in m1 (watch vignette in STAR)

### Todo
- [ ] There are less values at the beginning of the series in R, maybe *check d1df without cleandf*
- [ ] apply analysis to all couples
- [ ] analysis on couples sorted in reverse
- [ ] reimplement later analysis -> significant positive influence, peaks

### Done
- [x] Transformed :event to only 0s and 1s
- [x] Transferred dataframe from Julia to R, test results on both 
- [x] reproduced (partially) gss.analysis in Julia, calling gssanova and quickPredict from gss and STAR respectively
- [x] plotting works
- [x] discarded empty couples (NaN landmarks)

### Discarded
- [n] consider only active part
