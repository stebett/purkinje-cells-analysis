# Testing spline pipeline

### Doing
- [ ] reimplement later analysis -> significant positive influence, peaks
- [ ] fix script structure

### Todo
- [ ] redo with neigh computed from julia

### Done
- [x] find a way to save results
- [x] apply analysis to all couples
- [x] analysis on couples sorted in reverse (fit both since they are 2 different cells)
- [x] rescale x values on plots -> use inverse in m1 (watch vignette in STAR)
- [x] Transformed :event to only 0s and 1s
- [x] Transferred dataframe from Julia to R, test results on both 
- [x] reproduced (partially) gss.analysis in Julia, calling gssanova and quickPredict from gss and STAR respectively
- [x] plotting works
- [x] discarded empty couples (NaN landmarks)

### Discarded
- [n] consider only active part
- [n] There are less values at the beginning of the series in R, maybe *check d1df without cleandf* -> for now ignore it
