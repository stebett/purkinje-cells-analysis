# Reproducing smooth spline analysis

# Doing
- [x] test simulations
- [x] Start simulations


# Todo

# Done
- [x] Fix simulations -> understand why single cell uniformdf fails
- [x] 3x2 parameters for simulation: all vs neigh vs dist X multipsth vs lift
- [x] separated "simple" and "complex" analysis
