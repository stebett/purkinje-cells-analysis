# Context - 3 minutes

Present role of cerebellum in motor circuit, then cerebellar anatomy and functionality in the cortex, then perceptron 

Motor system
Learning (adaptive filter)
Adaptive filter as perceptron
Question on how microzones act on nuclei

Picture of cerebellar cortex being close to a perceptron like system
Picture of synchrony
Picture of microzone

# Recordings
Tetrodes during grasping recorded by student with recordings too
# Synchrony 
Picture of sorted spikes

1. do cell in the same microzone (recorded from a single tetrode) encode similiar features of the movement
2. are cells in a microzone exhibiting synchronous firing

Critical role of synchrony in Purkinje cells on activity of nuclei cells 

Picture of dynamic clamps

# Results

expalain what is grasping with the picture
explain landmarks

Briefly explain psth, exposing the fact that modulation is over a scale of 1 sec, bigger then the 
Show multi-psth  


## Figure 1
Add schematic for mpsth

## Figure 2
Add column for mpsth

## Figure 3
Cross correlation, indication of modulation
The critic is that is hard to make assessments of pairs of cells
We would want confidence interval on the interaction of cells 

## Figure 4
Conclude: 2 sentences that reflect the question expressed at the beginning

1. apparently we're expressing the same dynamics, there is an increase in synchrony of 10/20% 

I provide an implementation of smoothing spline that was proposed by Pousac to compute the psth, and we extended it to compute the interaction delay

My work will be part of a manuscript that I will sign as a co-author

This was a chance to explore the use of julia that I chose because we can have very different architectures of data, but we have core analyses that we need to apply, and that made me think that a multiple dispatch language was particularly fit for this.

Reproducible science: my work has focused on the accessibility of the analyses, and the code will be released along with the manuscript with 

# Each graph has to be explained verbally (x axis, y axis etc)
# Slides lighter than the figures of report
# Enter each slide with a scientific question and exit with a conclusion (also written at the bottom of each slide)
#
# Sketch the slides with:
# 1. entry point (a word in the title that you have to stress) (scientific quesiton)
# 2. 3 or 4 things that you need to say absolutely
# 3. Conclusion
# 4. Junction with the next slide (learn to be smooth)
#
# When reharsing, if stuck, write the sentence where you get stuck
# Summary every 3 or 4 slides (cumulative conclusions)
# Take into account when you feel that there is something wrong in the logic
