\section{Conclusion}

Our results indicate that neighboring cells in the cerebellar cortex have similar patterns of activation, and in particular their spike trains show near-to-synchronous spikes, with delays <5ms. This synchrony will favor synaptic summation in the postsynaptic nuclear neurons and probably allow controlling the postsynaptic targets with an accuracy of a few milliseconds.

This work thus support a role of Purkinje cells in timing deep cerebellar nuclei neurons firing by creating periods of ``forbidden firing'' at the time of synchronized Purkinje cells synchronized spikes and periods of lower inhibition between these events.
