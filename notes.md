## Already done

- [ ] Peri-Stimulus time histograms
- [ ] Similarity of time course using Correlation coefficient of spike density and of the firing rate
- [ ] Standardized cross-covariance

## What I wanna do with the data

- [x] Iterate it, having back also the behavioral landmarks
- [x] Take all the data using landmarks as indexes (like take grasp +- 10ms, being sure not to be too near lift)
- [x] Take 1 spike train with his behavioral landmarks
- [x] Divide it in bins of a chosen measure and count N of spikes inside each bin
- [x] Read the paper and see what they've done

- [ ] Normalize it

> How should I use different landmarks for the same spiketrain?
